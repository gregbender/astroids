Computer Graphics - Project 2
-----------------------------

This is a game similar to 'Asteroids'.  It is only partially complete.  Currently you can move the
'space ship' around, and fire bullets.  However collision detection is rather poorely implemented,
and collisions are not as exact as they should be.

There are 3 scenes than can be clicked through using the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.
Scene 1 -- Regular 'Asteroids Game'
Scene 2 -- 'Asteroids Game' with a mirrored box in the top right corner
Scene 3 -- Some random primitive objects being drawn
        -- the objects used here were the few 'extra' that I needed to implement,
           but were not being used in the 'Asteroids Game'
           
Program is compiled by:
make PROG=lab2

ISSUES
------
You can currently 'shoot' the asteroids, and they will be destroyed.  But if the ship
runs into one of the asteroids, they are not destroyed, the ship will
just pass through them.
